As a guideline, a proper noun is generally capitalized. You should definitely extract all names and places.\\n\\nThe conversation history is provided just in case of a coreference (e.g. \\\"What do you know about him\\\" where \\\"him\\\" is defined in a previous line) -- ignore items mentioned there that are not in the last line.\\n\\nReturn the output as a single comma-separated list, or NONE if there is nothing of note to return (e.g. the user is just issuing a greeting or having a simple conversation).\\n\\nEXAMPLE\\nConversation history:\\nPerson #1: how's it going today?\\nAI: \\\"It's going great! How about you?\\\"\\nPerson #1: good! busy working on Langchain. lots to do.\\nAI: \\\"That sounds like a lot of work!
